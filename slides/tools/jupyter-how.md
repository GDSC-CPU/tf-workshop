# [<logos-google /> Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Google "Colaboratory"

- <mdi-cloud class="text-blue-400" /> cloud-based, zero configuration required
  * you don't need a Python environment installed
- <img src="/images/nvidia.png" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline " /> Free access to GPUs
  * faster, and more VRAM than [budget gaming laptops][1]
  * [GTX 1080 is only around 15% faster on average][3]
- <mdi-share class="text-orange-400" /> Easy sharing
- <logos-google-drive /> Google Drive integration
- <logos-python /> Only supports Python
  > [Colab focuses on supporting Python and its ecosystem of third-party tools. We're aware that users are interested in support for other Jupyter kernels (eg R or Scala). We would like to support these, but don't yet have any ETA.][2]

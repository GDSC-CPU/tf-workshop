> ### The [**Universal Approximation Theorem**][1] tells us that Neural Networks has a kind of universality i.e. no matter what $f(x)$ is, ***there is a network that can approximately approach the result and do the job!*** This result holds for any number of inputs and outputs.

> #### [The ***universal approximation theorem***][2] says that neural networks can approximate any function. Now, this is powerful. Because, what this means is that **any task** that can be thought of as a function computation, can be performed/computed/**approximated** by neural networks.

* Almost any task that neural network does today is a function computation:
  * language translation
  * caption generation
  * speech to text
  * image classification
  * etc.

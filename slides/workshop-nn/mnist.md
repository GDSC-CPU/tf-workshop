* Many popular datasets are _"built-in"_, or _"preloaded"_ in many ML libraries
  - Boston Housing is one example: we don't have to load house pricing data from a CSV
  - although this dataset has [ethical issues][1], and was [deprecated][2] in Scikit-learn
* Convenience: gets rid of distractions in bringing your own images, loading CSVs
    - can focus on the core ML stuff
    - very helpful especially for learning and research

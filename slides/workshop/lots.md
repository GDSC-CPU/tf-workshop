# Machines need lots of data

- <twemoji-warning /> **Spoiler alert**: Example for image classification
  
  * image pixels [**flattened**][1] such that they become a single ROW in a matrix
    + an image of 100x100 pixels = 10k inputs if graysale, 30k if colored (RGB)
  * if you train with 30,000 pictures of cats and 30,000 pictures of dogs, then
    + that's 60,000 rows _(1 row per training sample)_
  * $10,000 \times 60,000$ matrix? _Take that EMath 2200!!_
  * Each neuron (_green circle_) are also matrices üòÅüòÅ
  * Many operations are safe to do in parallel
    - e.g. addition, multiplication, summation

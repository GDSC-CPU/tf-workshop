* replace the $y = 2x + 1$ training set with the _"house prices"_ you see on the left
  - <small>more like _"bahay-kubo"_ prices with 10 m<sup>2</sup> as the largest</small>
* predict the prices of house sizes it's never seen before:
  - try **8** $m^2$
  - try **12** $m^2$
* **[Optional]**: Graph the line that best fits all data points.
  - 💡 Examine `model.weights` to get $w_1$ and $w_0$.
* **[Optional]**: Graph the costs, and see the curve flatten. 
  - 💡 `history = model.fit(...)` and later, examine `history.history['loss']`

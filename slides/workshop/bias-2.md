# The Power of a Single Neuron

<img alt="bias" src="/images/bias-2.png" />

let's represent bias as $x_0$, and __let $x_0$ be always equal to $1$__,
now our output neuron is able to compute 

$y = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^1 w_ix_i$  
$y = w_1x_1 + w_0x_0$  
$y = w_1x_1 + w_0 \cdot 1$  

<span class="border-2 border-green-500 p-1 rounded-xl">$y = w_1x_1 + w_0$</span>

# ðŸŽ“ Time to graduate and use our own images

BTW: This is the _"easy"_ part

- eventually you want to use your own images
  - unless maybe your app recognizes handbags and numbers
- very uniform
  - objects are all centered.  
    - real world images have the _"target"_ in different locations
  - The shirts and handbags are upright
    - real pix have weird poses and angles
  - they're all the same size and aspect ratios
  - they're also noisy _(contain other objects)_

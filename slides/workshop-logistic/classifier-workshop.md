  a classifier!

- I prepared a notebook that contains **100** training samples, each has 2 exam
scores and their admission results:  
  - $1$ if admitted, $0$ if not admitted.
- The machine should classify scores it's never seen before, in a similar pattern 
to the training set.

The notebook's link will be sent via chat, or just <twemoji-keyboard /> <twemoji-keyboard />

# <logos-tensorflow /> TensorFlow Lite

- set of tools that enables **on-device** machine learning by helping developers 
  run their models on 
  - mobile
  - embedded
  - and edge devices

Optimized for on-device ML, by addressing 5 key constraints: 
- latency (there's no round-trip to a server)
- privacy (no personal data leaves the device)
- connectivity (internet connectivity is not required)
- size (reduced model and binary size) and 
- power consumption (efficient inference and a lack of network connections).

# Assumptions

You can code in any language, preferably

<logos-python style="width: 128px; height: 128px" />

- variables
- control structures (`if-else`, loops)
- sequences (strings, lists, tuples)
  * destructuring is a ➕
  * knowing dictionaries and `**kwargs` is a ➕
- functions
- OOP basics
  * getters, operator overloading is a ➕

<div class="mt-12 text-gray-500">
  You are not allergic to
</div>

* We'll also need <logos-dart /> Dart for the <logos-flutter /> apps we'll make.
  * but this is ~~secondary~~ just for fun and not our focus
